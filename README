The Think One Zero Repository contains all boxee applications developed
and supported by Think One Zero.

The apps:
* ESPN3: http://espn3.com

== Install ==

Since these aren't yet in the official repository, you need to 
add "http://repositroy.boxee.thinkonezero.com" as a 3rd party repository first

1. Apps
2. Add Repository (all the way on the bottom in the left pane) 
3. http://repositroy.boxee.thinkonezero.com

You'll then be able to see all apps in the repository and add them to your apps.
